# AdventD3
Advent JS third day

The function should return a string that represents the Christmas tree, constructed as follows:

The tree is made up of triangles of special characters.
The spaces on the sides of the tree are represented with underscores _.
All trees have a trunk of two lines, represented by the # character.
The tree should always have the same length on each side.
You must ensure the tree has the correct shape using line breaks \n for each line.

Example: 
const tree = createXmasTree(5, '*')
console.log(tree)
/*
____*____
___***___
__*****__
_*******_
*********
____#____
____#____
*/
